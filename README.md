# Augmented Reality PCB Assembly & Debugging App

This AR application is developed as part of my graduation project to assist users with interactive PCB assembly and testing. Built using Unity and Vuforia, the app overlays real-time information onto physical PCBs and guides users step-by-step through component placement and trace verification.

## ðŸ”§ Project Summary

- **Platform:** Unity (with Vuforia SDK)  
- **Target Device:** Android (tested), compatible with AR-supported devices  
- **Core Functionality:**  
  - Dynamic image target generation at runtime  
  - Dual-sided PCB tracking and alignment  
  - Real-time component placement guidance  
  - Component selection feedback and trace inspection  
  - Live 3D preview rendering of selected components  
  - BOM metadata linking and datasheet display via Mouser API  

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- **Assembly Mode:** Step-by-step guided assembly highlighting components (resistors, LEDs, ICs, etc.)  
- **Inspection Mode:** View PCB nets, connections, and underlying traces  
- **Trace Overlay:** Visual highlighting of electrical traces between interconnected pads  
- **Live Component Preview:** Real-time 3D view of components on the board  
- **BOM & Datasheet Lookup:** Matches components with part numbers and fetches datasheets from Mouser API
